## Background
This project was motivated by my industry experience of developing a text-to-sing product. As a linguist, I hoped to give my engineer colleagues some more information from a linguistics perspective to solve the badcases. This project includes two major themes across two languages, Mandarin and English, and was partially funded by a small grant I received (Postdoctoral Research Associate Summer Research Prize, University of Kent, UK, 2020). The themes included are segment proportion and beat alignment. I presented some preliminary results at a number of conferences, together with my student assistants and colleagues.
