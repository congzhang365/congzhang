    abstract     = {This paper aims to more precisely specify the nature of pitch expansion in question focus in Korean, as a precursor to the computational modelling of a discriminative learning process based on prosodic cues. The work is important because it strengthens a potential account that allows formal links between prosody and syntactic analysis. In focusing on phenomena at the trailing edge of the scope of focus, it can be used alongside left-to-right statistical machine translation to improve the output of speech recognition systems, without requiring a full statistical parse of the input, and in speech generation systems to reduce the ambiguity of output.}
